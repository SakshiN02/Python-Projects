## ❓ *Problem Statement*  
E-commerce businesses often face challenges in *understanding sales patterns* and predicting how different factors affect revenue. This project aims to answer:  
✔ How do *price and discount levels* impact sales volume?  
✔ What is the *relationship between marketing spend and revenue*?  
✔ Are there *seasonal trends or anomalies* in the sales data?  
✔ Can we identify *outliers* that may indicate pricing errors or promotional boosts?  

By analyzing these factors, we can provide actionable insights to help businesses *optimize pricing strategies, improve marketing efficiency, and increase overall profitability*.

## 📊 *Data Preprocessing & Cleaning*  
Before analysis, we ensure the dataset is clean and well-structured by:  
✔ *Handling missing values* to avoid biases in results.  
✔ *Checking for duplicate entries* to maintain data integrity.  
✔ *Converting data types* for better analysis (e.g., categorical vs. numerical).  
✔ *Detecting and managing outliers* to avoid skewed results.

## 📈 *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Visualizations*  

### 📌 *1. Histogram Plots (Histplots) – Data Distribution Analysis*  
*Visualization Used:* Seaborn Histplots with KDE  
- *Purpose:* Understand the distribution of key numerical variables.  
- *Histograms Generated For:*  
  - *Price:* Displays product price distribution.  
  - *Discount:* Highlights the frequency of different discount levels.  
  - *Marketing Spend:* Shows variations in advertising budgets.  
  - *Units Sold:* Reveals trends in product sales.  
- *Insight:*  
  - Price and discount distributions help in identifying optimal pricing strategies.  
  - Marketing spend distribution can show whether investments are evenly spread or concentrated on specific campaigns.

### 📌 *2. Boxplots – Outlier Detection & Variability Analysis*  
*Visualization Used:* Seaborn Boxplots  
- *Purpose:* Identify outliers and variations in sales-related data.  
- *Boxplots Generated For:*  
  - *Price:* Detects extreme pricing fluctuations.  
  - *Discount:* Highlights products with unusually high or low discounts.  
  - *Units Sold:* Shows variations in product demand.  
- *Insight:*  
  - Some products have steep discounts, which might lead to short-term spikes in sales.  
  - Certain price ranges might be more stable, meaning they have fewer extreme variations.

### 📌*3. Correlation Matrix – Feature Relationship Analysis🔥*
Visualization Used: Seaborn Heatmap

Purpose: Identify relationships between numerical features in the dataset.

How it Works:

A heatmap is created from the correlation matrix.

Darker and lighter shades represent strong and weak correlations, respectively.

The annotated values indicate the correlation strength between variables.

*Insights:*

✅ Strong positive correlation between marketing spend and units sold, confirming that higher ad budgets lead to higher sales.

✅ Negative correlation between discount and price, indicating discounted items are generally lower-priced.

✅ Moderate correlations between price and units sold, suggesting pricing strategy influences demand.

### 📌*4. Scatter Plots – Relationship Analysis 🎯*
📌 Scatter Plot: Price vs. Units Sold
Visualization Used: Seaborn Scatterplot

Purpose: Understand how product pricing affects sales volume.

Observations:

✅ Lower-priced products tend to sell in higher quantities.

✅ Some higher-priced products still maintain strong sales, indicating premium product demand.

✅ The trend suggests a negative correlation between price and sales volume.

📌 Scatter Plot: Marketing Spend vs. Units Sold
Visualization Used: Seaborn Scatterplot

Purpose: Analyze the impact of marketing budget on sales performance.

Observations:

✅ Higher marketing spend generally leads to higher sales, but with diminishing returns at higher spend levels.

✅ Some products receive low marketing budgets yet still achieve strong sales, indicating organic demand or brand loyalty.

✅ The trend highlights the importance of strategic budget allocation for maximum ROI.
