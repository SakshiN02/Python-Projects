📊 Stock Market Analysis with Python

🏆 Problem Statement

The stock market is a complex ecosystem where prices fluctuate based on various factors. Investors and traders need robust analytical tools to make informed decisions. This project focuses on analyzing Tata Global's stock data using Python and deriving meaningful insights to assist in investment decisions.

🔍 Project Overview

In this project, we:

✅ Fetched real-time stock data using Quandl 📥

✅ Explored historical trends and stock price movements 📈

✅ Visualized key metrics using Matplotlib & Seaborn 🎨

✅ Designed a Buy (+1) or Sell (-1) classification model 🤖.

🎨 Visualizations & Insights
This project features two key visualizations that provide insights into stock price movements:

📌 Scatter Plot: Open vs. High 📊

Displays the relationship between the opening price and the daily high of the stock.

Helps identify trends in price surges and intraday volatility.

A useful tool for assessing how often stocks break past their opening price.
