⚽ FIFA Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 📊

🔍 Project Overview

This project involves an in-depth exploratory data analysis (EDA) of FIFA player data. The goal is to uncover key insights into player attributes, trends, and distributions using Python. The analysis includes data cleaning, visualization, and statistical summaries to better understand the dataset.

📂 Dataset

The dataset contains various attributes of FIFA players, such as:

🏆 Player Name

🎂 Age

⭐ Overall Rating

🚀 Potential Rating

💰 Value and Wage

🏟️ Club and Nationality

⚡ Physical and Skill Attributes (Pace, Dribbling, Passing, etc.)

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

🐍 Python for data processing and visualization

🏗️ Pandas for data manipulation

📈 Matplotlib & Seaborn for visualizations

🔢 NumPy for numerical operations

**📊 Key Insights & Visualizations**

Below are some of the key analyses performed along with the visualizations:

📊 Age Distribution of Players

A histogram that displays the age distribution of players, helping identify the most common age groups in professional football.
This visualization can reveal trends such as whether most players fall within a specific age range.

📉 Correlation Between Player Attributes

A heatmap that visualizes correlations between different player attributes (e.g., pace, shooting, passing, dribbling, etc.).
This can uncover relationships between different skills, such as whether high dribbling ability is strongly correlated with high passing ability.

📊 Overall and Potential Ratings by Age Group

Two boxplots analyzing the distribution of Overall and Potential ratings across different age groups.
Helps in understanding how player ratings vary as they grow older.

Key Insight: Younger players tend to have higher potential, while older players show more consistency in their overall ratings.

🔍 Potential vs Age (Scatter Plot)

A scatter plot that visualizes the relationship between player age and potential rating.

Key Insight: Younger players generally have higher potential, whereas older players reach their peak or plateau.

⚡ Overall vs Potential (Scatter Plot)

A scatter plot comparing Overall Rating and Potential Rating for players.

Key Insight: Players with high Overall Ratings tend to have a smaller gap between their potential and current ability, while younger players may have higher potential but lower overall ratings.

🚀 How to Run the Notebook

Install the required libraries using:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

Open the Jupyter Notebook and run all cells sequentially.

🏁 Conclusion

This analysis provides valuable insights into FIFA player attributes, helping to understand trends in player performance, market value, and other characteristics. Further analysis could involve predictive modeling or deeper statistical insights.
